## What is UrbanDict.sh?
It is a very simple tool in wich you can query words in Urban Dictionary, and get results via using Unofficial Urban Dictionary API from rapidapi.
## How to install and use it?
I am programming bash for 2 days so I will only be able to show how I use it like a real noob ðŸ˜Ž.  
Firstly clone the repo to your local.
```git
$ git clone https://github.com/patern0ster/UrbanDict.sh.git
```
First way to do it is you have to go to the directory where you cloned the UrbanDict.sh and giving every permission to the program.  
```bash
$ chmod 777 UrbanDict.sh
$ ./UrbanDict.sh
```

Or you can simply do:

```bash
$ bash UrbanDict.sh
```
